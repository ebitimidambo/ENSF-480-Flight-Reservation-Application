# Project Overview

This project is a **Java application** built using:

- **Swing** for the graphical user interface  
- **MySQL** for database integration  

The program is packaged as a **JAR file** and can be run on any system with a compatible **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**.

# Running the Application

## Required Files

To run the program, you must have:

- `Flight Reservation Application - Group 16.jar`
- The `images` folder (provided in the submission)

These two items must be placed in the **same directory**.

---

# Why the Images Folder Is Included

The application uses external images for:

- Icons  
- Backgrounds  
- Other visual and aesthetic elements  

Important notes:

- The images **do not affect application logic**.
- The application will still run normally if the `images` folder is missing.
- Missing images will cause certain UI elements to display **default placeholders** instead.

# Running the JAR

You can start the application by:

- Double-clicking the JAR file  

**Or**

Run it from the command line:

```bash
java -jar "Flight Reservation Application - Group 16.jar"
